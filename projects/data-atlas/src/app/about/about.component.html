    population patterns in the past, plants and disturbances, animal development, and climate change. This atlas will give strategic
    guidelines and policy measures for politicians and landscape practitioners, prove the strength of interdisciplinary research in academia
    in the Anthropocene and to raise sustainable awareness on landscape reform among academia, the commerce and the general public.
